# LELEC2870 Machine Learning Project: Predicting a person's weight based on eating habits and physical activities

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In this project, we apply Machine Learning to predict the weight (and BMI) of people based on their eating habits and physical activities.

The data that we are working with was garnered from a study conducted in Colombia, Peru and Mexico. Participants were asked, during a survey, a multitude of questions regarding their eating habits, their mode of transportation to work etc.
